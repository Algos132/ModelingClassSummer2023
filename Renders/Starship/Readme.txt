for unknown reasons, Github has been unable to push the render files that would go in this folder.
The files are being stored on my personal laptop for the time being.

This may be because my regular desktop, which the source of the repository, is out for repairs, and until it returns 
I may have to screen record my rendered models for the time-being. When my computer returns I will transfer
the render files onto that machine and pushing try again.
